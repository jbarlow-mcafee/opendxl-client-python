ePO Broker Certificates Export
==============================

The certificate information for DXL Brokers must be available to DXL clients attempting to connect
to the fabric. This certificate information allows clients to ensure the Brokers being connected to are valid
(via mutual authentication).

The following steps walk through the process to export the DXL Broker certificate information:

1. Navigate to **Server Settings** and select the **DXL Certificates (Third Party)** setting on the left navigation bar.

    .. note::
    
        If using an older version of the DXL ePO Extensions, the **Server Settings** in the ePO console may have only a  
        single option for all DXL certificates (titled "**DXL Certificates**"). Click that setting, and proceed with the 
        rest of the steps in this guide as normal.

2. Click the **Edit** button in the lower right corner (as shown in the image above)

3. Click the **Export All** button in the **Broker Certificates** section (as shown in the image above)

4. The exported file, ``brokercerts.crt``, will be saved locally.

   This file is specified as the ``broker_ca_bundle`` parameter when constructing a
   :class:`dxlclient.client_config.DxlClientConfig` instance.

   This file can also be specified via a configuration file used to instantiate a
   :class:`dxlclient.client_config.DxlClientConfig` instance.

   See the :func:`dxlclient.client_config.DxlClientConfig.create_dxl_config_from_file` method for more information.
